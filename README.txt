These are the source data files and build scripts used to maintain the Icelandic Saga Database (www.sagadb.org)

The data files are stored as XML in the ./src directory, and can be converted into a variety of different formats, including:

    * HTML web pages for the sagadb.org website
    * XHTML
    * PDF (using html2ps and pstopdf)
    * Plain text (UTF-8)
    * EPUB
    * Synthesized speech audio files (using the Mac OS X Speech Synthesizer)

The scripts and modules for working with the source XML files are written in Perl and use XML::Parser::Lite::Tree.

All code is BSD licensed.

All saga source texts are in the public domain.
