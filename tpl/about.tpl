<h1>About the Icelandic Saga Database</h1>

<p>The Icelandic Saga Database is a non-profit enterprise maintained and administered by volunteers in their spare time. The project was conceived in 2007, with the aim of making the classic Sagas of the Icelanders available in multiple languages in a variety of open formats in a single, central repository.  Through countless hours of work, we now host the largest repository of saga translations on the Internet, offering the saga texts in plain text, HTML, XML, EPUB and PDF formats.</p>
