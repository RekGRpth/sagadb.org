<h1>About the Icelandic Saga Database</h1>

<p>The Icelandic Saga Database is a non-profit enterprise maintained and administered by volunteers in their spare time.  
    The project was conceived in 2007, with the aim of making the classic Sagas of the Icelanders available in 
    multiple languages in a variety of open formats in a single, central repository.  Through countless hours of work, 
    we now host the largest repository of saga translations on the Internet, offering saga texts in plain text, HTML, XML,
    EPUB and PDF formats.</p>

<h2>Copyright Status</h2>

<p>All the saga texts on this website, unless otherwise specified, are in the public domain.  This means that you are free to copy, modify, distribute and use  them as you like, for any purposes, free of charge.</p>

<p>We are also always looking for new material.  If you know of any online public domain translation of one of 
    the sagas (into any language) which is not already available on this website, then by all means 
    <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> and let us know.</p>

<p>We also need in help in veryfing and error-checking the texts.  If you find any errors or mistakes in the 
    texts themselves, please let us know.  Many of these texts have been processed using Optical Character 
    Recognition software, and the results of such software are often faulty despite our best efforts to correct them.</p>
